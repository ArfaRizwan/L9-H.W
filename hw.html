    <h1>Cascading Style Sheet</h1>
    <div>
<p class="T1">
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language fundamental to web development, used to describe the presentation of a document written in markup languages like HTML or XML. It dictates how elements should be rendered on various media, including screens, paper, and in speech. CSS separates the content of a web page from its visual presentation, allowing for greater flexibility and control over design. This separation enables web developers to manage the aesthetics of a website efficiently, applying consistent styles across multiple pages or easily updating the look and feel without altering the underlying content.

The "cascading" aspect of CSS refers to the algorithm browsers use to resolve conflicts when multiple style rules apply
to the same element. This hierarchy determines which styles take precedence based on factors such as specificity,
importance, and source order. Styles defined with higher specificity (e.g., an ID selector) generally override those
with lower specificity (e.g., a tag selector). Similarly, styles marked as !important override other rules, and
later-defined styles in the source code often override earlier ones if specificity is equal.

CSS provides a vast array of properties to control every visual aspect of a web page, including layout, typography,
colors, backgrounds, and animations. Properties like display, position, and flexbox or grid are used for arranging
elements on the page. Text formatting properties like font-family, font-size, color, and text-align manage the
appearance of text. Additionally, CSS enables the creation of responsive designs, ensuring websites adapt seamlessly to
different screen sizes and devices through features like media queries, enhancing user experience across various
platforms.
